# Academic Information System

A WinForms + MySQL Academic Information System that includes:

- **Admin Dashboard** — manage students, teachers, groups, subjects  
- **Teacher Dashboard** — view subjects, assign/edit/delete grades  
- **Student Dashboard** — view grades and corresponding subjects/teachers  

The system uses MySQL as the backend database and auto-initializes sample data using a **DatabaseSeeder**.

---

## Database Setup (MySQL)

### 1. Create the database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE ais;
```

No tables need to be created manually — the application automatically creates and populates all data (ais.sql).

---

## Configure Database Connection

Open:

```
AIS/Database/DatabaseConnection.cs
```

Update your MySQL password:

```csharp
private static readonly string connectionString =
    "server=localhost;user=root;password=YOUR_PASSWORD;database=ais;";
```

Replace **YOUR_PASSWORD** with your MySQL server password.

---

## DatabaseSeeder (Automatic Initial Data)

The seeder runs on the first launch and automatically inserts:

- Admin account  
- Student group (PI24E)  
- Example student accounts  
- Full subject list  
- One unique teacher per subject  
- All subject→group assignments  
- All teacher→subject assignments  

It is triggered inside:

```
Program.cs
```

```csharp
DatabaseSeeder.Seed();
```

### After running once:
You may **delete or comment out** the call to avoid re-seeding (though the seeder includes duplicate checks).

---

## Login Credentials

### Admin:
```
login: admin
password: admin
```

### All other autogenerated accounts:
```
login = first name
password = last name
```

---

## Running the Application

1. Install MySQL  
2. Create the `ais` database  
3. Update password in `DatabaseConnection.cs`  
4. Run the project  
5. Log in using admin or any test account

---

## ✔️ Ready to Use

The system is fully functional once seeded. You may modify, extend, or replace the data as needed.
